# Solar-Tracking-System-
A solar tracking system using Arduino is a device designed to optimize the orientation of a solar panel to follow the movement of the sun across the sky throughout the day. By doing this, the system ensures that the solar panel receives the maximum possible sunlight, increasing its energy efficiency.
